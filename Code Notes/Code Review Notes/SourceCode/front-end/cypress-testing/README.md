# Cypress Demo

## Description

[Cypress](http://www.cypress.io) is another E2E testing tool like [Nightwatch.js](https://nightwatchjs.org/).

The main difference is that Cypress has a built-in integrated UI through [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), which is very beginner friendly for those new to front-end testing.  

The demo will open Cypress in UI mode and the user can use the guided tour to walkthrough setting up E2E tests by executing the built-in examples.  

## Directions

1. Install/update required node packages  
    ```npm install```

2. Run the demo  
    ```npm run test:cy```
